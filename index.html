			Hi my name is Cesar Felipe Lopez and I am currently a Computer Science Major at California State University, Los Angeles. Most of my life I have lived in San Diego, more specificlly Chula Vista. As a freshmen I moved to Los Angeles to persue a CS degree at CSULA. Throughout my time as a student I have learned how to use many programs which include Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and IDE's such as Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Android Studio. To use some programs I also had to learn languages such as HTML, CSS, Java, and C++. I have organized below a list of projects I have created. Note: Many projects can be missing links or incomplete due to loosing many projects due to a faulty HDD. Always back up you things people! Computer Hardware fails and it can happen to you!

				<h4>Transformation Lab </h4>
				I created this in high school in a multimedia class where we learned how to use Macromedia Flash 8. This project is a simulation of a step in a transformation lab. It would go on to win at a local school district contest and at the Dell Mar (I mean San Diego) Fair Student Competition.
